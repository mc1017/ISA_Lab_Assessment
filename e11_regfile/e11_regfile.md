e11 - Register file
-------------------

Create a module called `regfile` which implements a MIPS-like
register file, but with just four registers. The ports are 

- `clk` : clock input
- `write_enable` : input - If asserted the value in `write_data` is written to `write_index`
- `write_index` : input - 2-bit index to write value at
- `write_data` : input - 32-bit value to write 
- `read_a_index` : input - 2-bit index to read value a from
- `read_a_data` : output - 32-bit value read from `read_a_index`
- `read_b_index` : input - 2-bit index to read value b from
- `read_b_data` : output - 32-bit value read from `read_b_index`

The write-port is sequential, so if `write_enable` is true then the
register at `write_index` is not written till the rising edge of the clock.

The two read-ports are combinatorial, so if `read_a_index` is changed
the value at `read_a_data` will be updated within the clock cycle.

Register index 0 is always 0, so even if a non-zero value is written to it
any reads from index 0 should always produce 0.

The module's timing and semantics should be equivalent to those used in the
MIPS data-path developed in the first week of lectures, except it has four
registers rather than 32.

Registers in the register file have undefined
read values until they have been written at least once.
