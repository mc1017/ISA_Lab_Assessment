e7 - Rewriting
--------------

Modify the module `multiplier` so that it contains no `always_comb` or `always`
statements, but still has the same functionality. You can use any
other Verilog language constructs (i.e. keywords, operators, statements,
expressions) you like, as long as the keywords `always_comb` and `always` do not appear.
